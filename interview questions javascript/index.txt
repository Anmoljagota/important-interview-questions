1q=>what is a javascript
ans=>introduction => Javascript is a scripting programming language which is primilarly use to create interactive , dynamic and complex elements on web 
pages . it is developed by a breadon eich at netscape commumnication in mid 1990's . it is a brain of a web pages . 
for example => when we click on button in websites some dialog box alert box is appeard on the page something happened when we click on
something . most of the functionality and logic which is implement on the pages are built by a js.
popularity=>jvascript is flexible and most widely used language . before introduced the node js in the market javascript is quite famous 
but not that much nowdays before node js javascript is client side language and only used as a frontend but after introdued the node js 
it gave the flexibility to use js outside the browser and as a server side scripting language .

uses=> framework and library that is built in the top of js like react angular and vue makes the js more interseting and with the help of
this we can make a more user friendly ui . 

2q=>what is a Promises
ans=>Promises is a object that represent the eventual completion of a asyc task which may happening or happen in the future .
A javascript is a single threaded language and it will not stop even the some code taking time but with the help of Promise
we can easily handle the asyc operation in a more better way .

 A promise can be a three states
 1.)pending => The promise are still in the processing state 
 2.) fullfilled => A promise resolved
 3.) Rejected =>   A promise rejected

for example=> Assume that there is one ecomerce website what happened in the ecommerce website first user add the items in the cart 
then user do the procced the payment and then payment successfull
we need to do this all the things in a order manner means always first user add into the cart then proced to payment and then payment 
successfull . any point of time it can't we happened like payment execute first and then add to cart happened this thing we can do with the 
help of a promises;
 A promise come with the alot of benefits like =>
 1)inversion of control => in the callback function it might happened then function run two or three time even not run but in the 
 promise everything in developers hand 
 2)callback hell problem solved 

 3q=>what is a call.
 ans=>Call is a javascript built in function that allow to call a function with a specife this keyword and according to the argument 
 provided . it is a powerfull feature that change the context like the refernce of the this to those object where call method is set .

 4q=>what is a apply
 ans=>apply is same like a call it also call a function with specific this keyword but difference only lies in between a argument 
 we can provide a argument in apply as a array of elements but not in call

5q=> what is a bind 
ans=> bind bassically store the function and we can invoke that function later point of time . in the call and apply when function is call 
then it immadiately invoked so we do't have a control of execution of function but in bind we have a control on function.

6Q=>what is a JSON
ans=>JSON is javascript object notation which has a text based data format following the object syntax . it is litewait and widely used
to transfer the data over the internet because of it lightwait it consume a less bandwidth . ans also to store the data JSON is widely used
to communicate between the api JSON is widely used by th edevelopers.

7q=>Arrow function in js
ans=>Arrow function is concise syntax for creating function . it is introduced in ECMASCRIPT(6) es6 to write a function in shorter cleaner 
way . in a trandition function it is neccesary to write a return if we are returning from the function but in arrow function we don't need 
to wrire a return statement
Arrow function has its own features
1.) Arrpw function has not bind its own this value it get the this from its legixal scope value 
2.)because of not this in arrow function concept of call,apply and bind in arrow function is difficult to implement
3.)we can not use a constructors in arrow function .

8q=>What is the Temporal Dead Zone
ans=>The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

Let's see this behavior with an example,

function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}

9q=>How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?
ans=>encodeURI() function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string. decodeURI() function is used to decode an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.

Note: If you want to encode characters such as / ? : @ & = + $ # then you need to use encodeURIComponent().

let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);

10q=>What is memoization
ans=>Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache. Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

const memoizAddition = () => {
  let cache = {};
  return (value) => {
    if (value in cache) {
      console.log("Fetching from cache");
      return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
    } else {
      console.log("Calculating result");
      let result = value + 20;
      cache[value] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
};
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached


10q=>What are server-sent events
ans=>Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP
 connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. 
 This has been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

 11q=>How do you receive server-sent event notifications
ans=>The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,

if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
  var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
  source.onmessage = function (event) {
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
  };
}

11q=>How do you check browser support for server-sent events
ans=>You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,

if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
  // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
} else {
  // No server-sent events supported
}

11q=>Event Loop in javascript.
ans=>Event loop is a fundamental concept of a javascript which allows the developer to run a code asycronous way . a javascript is
a signle treaded language it means that it run a code line by line . but there is some web api's that take some time to run 
because of its single treaded if it takes this web api's as a syncronus way then the performance of the application is quite 
low . to make it as a async js comes up with a event loop . there is only a one call stack where all the code run 
if there is some web api taking a time then it will go to the call back queue and rest of the code still run side by side 
here the concept of event loop come event loop contineously check the call stack and the call back queue if there is some api 
in the call back queue and the call stack is empty the it push that api in the call stack .
