1q=>what is a javascript
ans=>introduction => Javascript is a scripting programming language which is primilarly use to create interactive , dynamic and complex elements on web 
pages . it is developed by a breadon eich at netscape commumnication in mid 1990's . it is a brain of a web pages . 
for example => when we click on button in websites some dialog box alert box is appeard on the page something happened when we click on
something . most of the functionality and logic which is implement on the pages are built by a js.
popularity=>jvascript is flexible and most widely used language . before introduced the node js in the market javascript is quite famous 
but not that much nowdays before node js javascript is client side language and only used as a frontend but after introdued the node js 
it gave the flexibility to use js outside the browser and as a server side scripting language .

uses=> framework and library that is built in the top of js like react angular and vue makes the js more interseting and with the help of
this we can make a more user friendly ui . 

2q=>what is a Promises
ans=>Promises is a object that represent the eventual completion of a asyc task which may happening or happen in the future .
A javascript is a single threaded language and it will not stop even the some code taking time but with the help of Promise
we can easily handle the asyc operation in a more better way .

 A promise can be a three states
 1.)pending => The promise are still in the processing state 
 2.) fullfilled => A promise resolved
 3.) Rejected =>   A promise rejected

for example=> Assume that there is one ecomerce website what happened in the ecommerce website first user add the items in the cart 
then user do the procced the payment and then payment successfull
we need to do this all the things in a order manner means always first user add into the cart then proced to payment and then payment 
successfull . any point of time it can't we happened like payment execute first and then add to cart happened this thing we can do with the 
help of a promises;
 A promise come with the alot of benefits like =>
 1)inversion of control => in the callback function it might happened then function run two or three time even not run but in the 
 promise everything in developers hand 
 2)callback hell problem solved
